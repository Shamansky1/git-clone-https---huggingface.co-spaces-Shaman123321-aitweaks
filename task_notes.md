# System Optimization App Development Tracker

## Current Progress
- [x] Created tracking document
- [x] Initialized project structure
- [x] Set up Electron main process (main.js)
- [x] Created base UI framework (index.html)
- [x] Established core styling (styles.css)
- [x] Implemented renderer process (renderer.js)
- [x] Added performance monitoring IPC
- [x] Implemented optimization tools IPC
- [x] Preserved embedded music player
- [x] Preserved YouTube video embed

## Completed Features
- Real-time CPU monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Disk activity metrics
- Network performance data
- Embedded music player (preserve existing)
- YouTube video embed (preserve existing)

## Next Steps
1. Implement IPC communication for:
   - Performance metric updates
   - Optimization tool triggers
2. Add system monitoring functionality
3. Create disk cleanup implementation
4. Develop registry scanning tools

## UI Requirements
- Maintain existing button styles
- Keep consistent metric card design
- Preserve current color scheme
- Follow established IPC patterns

## Notes
- All new features must match existing UI design
- Error handling must be consistent with current patterns
- Performance monitoring should update in real-time
