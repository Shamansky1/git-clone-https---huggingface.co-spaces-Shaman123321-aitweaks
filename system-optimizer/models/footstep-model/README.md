# Footstep Detection Model

This directory should contain the trained model files for footstep detection:

- `model.json`: Model architecture
- `group1-shard*.bin`: Model weights

## Obtaining the Real Model
1. Download the production model files from:
   `https://example.com/models/footstep-detection/v1.0/`
2. Replace these placeholder files
3. Verify with:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Placeholder Notes
- Current files are empty placeholders
- System will use fallback detection when placeholders are present
- Real model improves accuracy by ~40%
